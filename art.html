                    <p>A piece worked on by Paul Reimer and Nathan Siemens, Connected Ribbon seeks to involve the community with its structure and form. Made with the intent of having not only a unique design, but also to have it designed in a way that skate boarders to interact with the piece. In following both of the goals we have this piece today, one that can not only be enjoyed for it's place as a work of art, but also as an interactive installation that skate boarders can engage with.</p>

                    <p>Being an interactive installment, Listen focuses on the sound around it, with it's unique design allowing it to function as a sound mirror. Not seeking to create something new, but instead to highlight the sounds and experiences of the nature around it. Sitting infront of the concave area allows the listener to immerse themselves on the land around them. Each individual viewing with this piece allows for completely different experiences, one day you may hear nothing but the wind, and the next it could highlight the myraid of wildlife out in the coulees, such as the cries of nearby birds.</p>

                    <p>Staged as the entry to the Royal View Memorial Cemetery, Threshold gates function as a literal and metaphorical transition into the solemn place of rest for many different peoples. The core of the piece remains stationary, be it open or closed, it's cyclical nature highlight the exact same nature of the process of grieving one might go through when dealing with the passing of a relative, going from their normative state, to grieving, and over a period of acceptance and mourning, back to their normative state. </p>

                    <p>Being an example of social infrastructure, an installation that invites the idea of play
                        and social interaction. The piece seeks to tackle the the complex topic that is our own 
                        identity, being shaped not only by our heritage, the circumstances of our birth,
                        lived in experiences or the land we share, and who we share it with.</p>
